# Education: do computers allow us to study less facts but more understanding

To conduct debates we obviously need multiple (or at least two) points of view and we need «pro» et «contra» arguments for each side.

### Thesis

> The world is changing and computers technologies and the Internet make data access incommensurably easier, so it doesn't make sense to memorize pure data. The era of the Internet is time for creativity in all domains of human activity.

OK, Let the debate begin!

### Pro

It's a common issue, that sometimes learners face rote learning. They are nor learned how to analyze but instead they are forced to memorize useless data, amounts of which might be **terrifying**.

But today everybody has an access to almost all the human knowledge!

Nevertheless pupils are still forced to memorize data instead of understanding it. Here's an interesting example (we can see students learning the Koran instead of **understanding** it… Forget it, it's a joke……):

Here comes an obvious question. Why should the learners rote all the data if they can simply **google** it?! Do you see a dialectic contradiction here? May be, you don't. But it exists.

It's the contradiction between the basis and the superstructure. The technological progress can't be stopped and it will overturn the superstructure someday. One of the expressions of this contradictions is the fact of using phones for coping on school tests. I am convinced, that in the 

We shouldn't perceive the contradiction between the basis and the superstructure as something intrinsic for economics only. We might not see them everywhere, but they exist in all spheres of our lives. For example, American tribes and, in particularly, the Iroquois tribe have a pretty interesting family member naming. Th kids of brothers called each other as well as sisters' children. But, however, kids of sister and brother are not called so! The scientists have identified that this naming convention is conditioned by the previous, rudimentary wedding system in which almost everybody was permanently married to everybody of humans of the opposite sex, excluding only blood brothers and sisters. Despite the fact that the basis (marriage system) has changed (now they have a modern system of couple-wise marriage), the superstructure is only starting to do that.

To conclude, I think there are still going to be some conservators, who will protect the old rules, but they won't be able to fight with the base and the great changes will take place.

As for now, I suppose, that nowadays it makes sense to hold only conclusions (which are essentially strong points). And this

### Contra

Let others say something…







Encourage, support creativity

It's essentially abstract thinking, develop it!

Cultivate the habit of thinking in students!

Follow the rules:

1. Don't waste of time learning facts and figures (e. g. remove chemistry)
2. Provide Structurized data instead 
3. Make learners know, how did the humanity undersand it. This is the ony weat  
4. English:
   1. Conduct debates



Almost everything exists in our school!





How to practically implement personalize learning:

1. Perform testing
2. Split into classes by interests and abilities
3. Allow everybody to make their own schedule (unrealistic? E. g. in Itmo there was a group of students who were not satisfied by the amount of lessons in their faculty (≈3 lessons daily). They
