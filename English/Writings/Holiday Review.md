## Abkhazia

> ***The tasks from SB and WB are quite strongly connected, that's why I decided to combine the tasks. This article is suitable for both of them (in SB and in WB).***

If you're in sustainable tourism, if you care about preserving nature and about struggling with nature's enemies, you should definitely visit Abkhazia's picturesque resorts. All the resorts are situated in coastal region but you can easily find diverse landscapes there. For example in «Gantiadi» (aka Цандрипш), which lies in a tiny bay, there is a massive mountain range next to the coast line, the surface of which is covered by lush subtropical forests.

By the way, the coastlines are pretty wide in almost all the cities of the coastal region of Abkhazia and the seashores are pretty smooth, which is ideal for a beginner tourists. There are even no oceanic streams and big scary waves.

Actually, there are no disruptive speed boats there, because aboriginals are not able to afford them. 

But the main secret of their beauty is concluded in eco-friendly rubbish management.

Abkhazia is one of those progressive countries (such as Germany, India, The Great Britain, France, Japan and e.t.c.) who are integrating innovative system of rubbish recycling through composting:

Composting allows you to decrease the amount of rubbish lying in open landfills, to sort the remaining garbage more effectively and to maintain soil fertility.

Here's a fantastic scientific research paper whish I recommend you to review:

By the way, there is an eternal discussion about the most productive way of composting. Scientist from all around the world are arguing about if compost pits or compost piles are the most efficient composting structures.

Anyway, composting is getting more and more popular in the world community:

High-fertility soil is handy for sheep (real animals, not wave sheep), because they consume grass and the want it to de as lush as possible. That's why the surface of grasslands is fully covered by a white haze of sheep.

Surprisingly, the sheep in Abkhazia do well in intelligence tests! It's probably that way due to composting.

So, for people who care about the environment and want to make an environmentally-friendly holiday choice, I can recommend a visit to Abkhazia!
